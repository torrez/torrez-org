I first started making community-style websites sometime around 2000. One of the first things you learn when giving people access to your sites's URLs is that they will poke at them. Using a URL scheme like `/file/1`, `/file/2`, etc will quickly get inspected. If this is okay with you, then there's no reason not to do it. I think it can add a little whimsy (e.g., [http://mlkshk.com/r/123](http://mlkshk.com/r/123)) http://mlkshk.com/r/123 and maybe someone will build something nice on top of it.

Part of the fun of building something new is that voice in the back of your head (what if it has to scale?) that you sometimes listen to and sometimes ignore to get to where you need to be. What if someone downloads every file and builds a copy of what I built? :shrug:


In development there are "dark patterns" which are UX choices that are designed to trick people into doing something they wouldn't reasonably choose to do. I don't think of these as "bad" things. They're there because they are part of the ivision of what someone is building; like adding a .

It's why Instagram doesnt auto-link URLs (even on the web!?), they want you to stay in on the site. It's annoying but I get it.

When they built Twitter they thought about this. URLs to statuses contain a user's name which made it hard to run through every status number. You could watch the public timeline (fun but noisy) or choose to follow people and maybe make a new friend. (The API still calls these `friends`.)

Another good decision was to add protected accounts.
