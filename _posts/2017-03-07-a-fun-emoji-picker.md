I sometimes while I browse the emoji picker I’ll make the corresponding face I’m looking for. My goto is usually :grimace: for most things these days, and so it would be very pleasing to be able to pick an emoji by grimacing at my laptop camera and having that emoji character identified and inserted in the spot I need it. 

Hands on face, mouth open, mimicking a terrified scream would be a funny way to call up the :scream: emoji when you need it.
