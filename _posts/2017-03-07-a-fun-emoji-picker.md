I sometimes mimic the emoji expression Iâ€™m looking for by making the face I want while I browse. My goto is usually :grimace: for most things these days, and so it would be very pleasing to be able to pick an emoji by grimacing and having that emoji character inserted in the spot I need it rather than searching or remembering the short code. 

Hands on face, mouth open, mimicking a terrified scream would be a nice way to call up the :scream: emoji when you need it.
