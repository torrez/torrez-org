A nice thing that happened last week was that I passed Duolingo’s 50% French Fluency level. I can’t say I’m remotely *fluent* in French but suddenly every French phrase and loan-word we use in English jumps out at me from around corners. 

Sous vide…huh! 
Mardi gras…ahh!
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? Ah! That song is considerably less exotic now.

I know a fair amount of Spanish just having it around as a kid and taking courses in school, but I’ve never really dove into learning another language like this before. I still have a long way to go and would appreciate any advice you have on learning the language.
