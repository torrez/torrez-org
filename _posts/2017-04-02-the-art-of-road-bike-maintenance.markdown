I've been riding my bike to work for almost a year now. Five miles to work and five miles back, five days a week, which means I'm getting somewhere around 100 to 150 miles a month on it. Sometimes I can't ride my bike, but I try to ride to work as much as I can.

I'll even ride in the pouring rain (thanks [outlier](https://outlier.nyc/)) because it's not that much harder than not riding in the rain, but very few people ride when it's wet out so that means a little more elbow room at stop lights; plus it's easier to stay cool when climbing the hills.

All this riding (and rain/mud riding) has not been great for my bike. I paid for a couple tuneups to replace some broken parts, but I didn't realize how much I'd been neglecting my bike until I got it up on a bike stand andâ€”well, it wasn't good.

Enter Lennard Zinn's [Zinn & the Art of Road Bike Maintenance](http://amzn.to/2o0z6vy)! I spent a couple of nights reading and the more I read the more I realized the maintenance part of it is terrifyingly easy to do. In fact it's almost a bit embarrassing to admit that I wasn't doing it.

So today I took the bike apart, scraped the gunk off the chain, cleaned the cassette with a toothbrush, scrubbed my rims, and oiled the chain. Just like that I could feel the difference riding around my neighborhood.

I can't recommend Zinn's book more. It's highly readable and there was very little mystery about what he was talking about thanks to the many illustrations. Where I previously felt a little fearful of unscrewing something and not knowing how to screw it back on (take pictures!) I feel like I leveled up a bit and want to try more projects in the future.
